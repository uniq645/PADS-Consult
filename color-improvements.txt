Consider these to creates a modern, growth-oriented aesthetic that stands out from the traditional "all-blue" accounting competition.

### 1. The Color Roles

* **Sage Green (Primary):** Reserved for "conversion" elements. It tells the user where to look and what to click.
* **Navy Blue (Secondary):** Used for "authority" and "structure." It grounds the site and provides the professional weight required for audit and tax services.
* **Light Blue (Accent):** Used for "visual interest" and "guidance." This is best for small icons, borders, and the "wave" elements seen in the logo.

### 2. Element Breakdown

| Element | Color | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Main Navigation Bar** | **Navy** | Creates a strong, professional frame for the page. |
| **Primary CTA (Get in touch)** | **Sage Green** | High visibility; signals growth and approachability. |
| **Headings (H1, H2)** | **Navy** | Ensures text looks authoritative and is easy to read. |
| **Icons (Services)** | **Sage Green** | Makes the "Audit," "Tax," and "Software" icons pop. |
| **Section Borders/Dividers** | **Light Blue** | Modern, subtle separation without being "heavy." |
| **Secondary CTA (Learn more)** | **Transparent / Light Blue Border** | Stays present but doesn't compete with the Primary CTA. |
| **Footer Background** | **Navy** | Ends the page with a sense of stability and permanence. |

### 4. How to Style the Hero Slider

With Sage Green as the primary, your Hero slides (Hero1-Hero4) should follow this visual logic:

* **Overlay:** Use a **Navy** tint (`bg-brand-secondary/40`) over the images. This makes the white text extremely crisp.
* **Typography:** The Heading should be **White**, but use the **Light Blue** for a small "Overline" text (e.g., "SPECIALIST CONSULTANCY" in small caps above the main heading).
* **The Button:** The "Get in touch" button is **Sage Green** with **Navy** text. This creates a "Premium/Fresh" look that feels more modern than a standard blue button.


Use **brand-secondary (Navy)** for the navigation and footer backgrounds. All main headings must be **brand-secondary**. Use **brand-primary (Sage Green)** for all primary action buttons and service icons. Use **brand-accent (Light Blue)** for thin borders, decorative lines, and hover transitions on secondary links."
